      "English": "† 2And supper being ended,a the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him,† 3Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,ω 4rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. 5After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.† 6Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?”† 7Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.” 8Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.” 9Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” 10Jesus said to him, “He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.” 11For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, “You are not all clean.” "
