      "English": "• The Fast of the Pure Apostles (1/29) The faithful servant remains without blame / In heaven, his reward is great / Among all those who inherit with him / His share will be more abundant (2/29) Bethsaida in Galilee became famous / For there Peter the Apostle lived / He was known to be extremely zealous / His love for the kingdom of God was great (3/29) Jesus Christ, our God and King / Was walking along Galilee's sea / He saw the love Peter was showing / His pure intentions and his righteous deeds (4/29) Jesus found Peter's brother Andrew / For our Lord, he had great love / The two brothers, Simon Peter and Andrew / Were fishermen with a humble job (5/29) Our Lord Jesus called them and said, / \"I will make of you fishers of men / To go and catch the nations / With the Lord's divine net\" (6/29) The love of the disciples was pleasing to God / He called on them and they answered / They obeyed His word and followed His path / He gave them the keys to the kingdom (7/29) They were chosen to be in the faith / God gave them powers and authority / So they became strong and courageous / Through Christ our God the Almighty (8/29) Some people called Jesus Elijah / Some thought He was John or Jeremiah / Others thought He was one of the prophets / But Peter testified that He was the Messiah (9/29) \"You are Christ, Son of the living God / Creator of all seen and unseen / Light of light, true God of true God / Creator of all living things\" (10/29) Our Lord praised Peter saying, \"Blessed are you / For you do not speak by your abilities / But my Father in heaven has granted you / To speak of these hidden mysteries\" (11/29) \"God provided you with the light of the faith, / Of neither flesh nor blood did this faith spring / You are Peter and on this rock of faith / I build My church, a house of blessings\" (12/29) \"You, My disciples, will minister to My flock / And all shall listen to the word and obey / You will bind and loose on earth, and in heaven / I will give you comfort and strength every day\" (13/29) \"Your honor surpasses all description / Your words will reach the end of the world / I gave you the highest distinction / Those who despise you will be expelled\" (14/29) \"Now that you have become My own / You will watch over My sheep tirelessly / My faithful disciples whom I count upon / You will be rewarded in heaven greatly\" (15/29) Peter completed his struggle for the Lord, / Fighting as a soldier in God's army / He was put to death on the cross by Nero / The enemy of the Lord Almighty (16/29) Peter asked the Lord, and was granted / He gave him a share in the inheritance / With joy he received the crown of martyrdom / He is worthy of all praise and blessings (17/29) Another soldier fought in the army of Jesus / A great preacher and keeper of the Law / He was known as Saul of Tarsus / Who previously opposed the way of the Lord (18/29) He followed the teachings of the fathers / He learned the Torah and the prophets with passion / More zealous in the law than any other / His love for Jehovah was his foundation (19/29) Gamaliel, the teacher of the Jewish Law / Taught Saul the strictness of traditions / He persecuted Jesus' followers with zeal / To prisons, he bound them, both great and small (20/29) One day, Saul went on a journey to Damascus / To bring in more captured to Jerusalem / Walking like a roaring king with the promise / To put to death the disciples of the King of heaven (21/29) Suddenly, a great light from heaven shone / He fell to the ground and could not see / He heard a powerful voice calling his name, / \"Saul, Saul why are you persecuting Me?\" (22/29) Jesus, the forgiver of every sin, said, / \"I am Jesus whom you persecute / It is hard to kick against the goads / Go to Damascus, you will be told what to do.\" (23/29) Those who were with Paul indeed saw light / But they did not hear a voice nor understand / They were afraid from seeing such a sight / And they led Paul to the city by the hand (24/29) In Damascus, he went to Ananias, a devout man / To Paul he said, \"Receive your sight / Arise and be baptized, this is God's plan / And wash away your sins calling on Christ\" (25/29) The disciples spread the good news of the Lord / Went forth among the nations to evangelize / They made the nations disciples of the Lord / Those who were dead, now received new life (26/29) On the fifth of Epep we celebrate / The martyrdom of our two great saints / Saint Peter was crucified upside down in Rome / Saint Paul was beheaded by Nero on the same (27/29) We are the children of this godly church / We honor and praise our saintly preachers / Hail to you Saint Peter, the disciple of the Lord / Hail to you Saint Paul, our teacher (28/29) We entreat You, the Lord of Peter and Paul / With Your apostles, remember us / Jesus Christ, the ruler of every soul / Giver of life, bestow mercy upon us (29/29) You sent Your pure holy apostles / And made them guardians of the faith / Grant us Your Holy Spirit / Your endless mercy and Your saving grace "
