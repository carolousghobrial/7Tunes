      "English": "(1/14) Today the sayings are fulfilled / From the prophecies and the proverbs / As Zechariah prophesied and said / A prophecy about Jesus Christ. (2/14) O Daughter of Zion, a just King is come / He passes through you, riding on a foal / To purify your inhabitants / He is the Savior of all souls (3/14) Though He is our Judge and King / He rode on a colt in humility / Surrounded by His angelic hosts / He appeared in the likeness of men humbly (4/14) Today rejoices Jerusalem / And all the land of Naphtali sings / With a great voice saying, / \"Save us, O holy King!\" (5/14) From the trees they cut branches / And on the road they spread their vests / Chanting with hymns saying, / \"Hosanna in the highest!\" (6/14) From the palm and olive trees / Branches on the road were poured / The people cried out, \"Blessed is He / Who comes in the name of the Lord!\" (7/14) This is the promised day / Of which King David prayed / As he explained in the psalms / \"This is the day the Lord has made\" (8/14) \"Let us rejoice and be glad in it\" / Joyful are the souls of men / The light of dawn has emerged / And has shone upon every Christian (9/14) Today the blind have been granted sight / And the children have spoken / While they are still nursing babes / As David said in the psalms (10/14) \"Out of the mouth of babes and infants, / You have perfected praise\" / Today his saying came to pass / As the Lord Jesus was praised (11/14) When the inhabitants heard of His coming / At the Mount of Olives, they went to meet Him / They saw scribes and Pharisees around Him / His apostles, like shining stars, surrounding Him (12/14) We were all in Satan's trap / Through the sin of Adam, the first man / He came and saved the believers / His salvation reached every human (13/14) The pagans drew near to Him / And each one received what he sought / But Israel did not know the Lord / They strayed away and fought the law (14/14) The ignorant walked in uprightness / But the wise ignored the visible proof / Denying the power of the glorified / And was blind to the tangible truth"
